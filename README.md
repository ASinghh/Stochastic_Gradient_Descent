This is another assignment for the SDS 385 (Stats method for Bigdata), in  this I have written a Stochastic Gradient function from the scratch 
and used it on a logistic regression data. I created the data randomly.

Further we have explored the effects of change in :
1. Batch size,
2. learning rate
3. step size


average step loss couldnt reduce further than 0.25

Go through the Ipython notebook, I have tried to make it very explanatory.
